Longest Consecutive subsequence in Java
Here, in this page we will discuss the program to find the longest consecutive subsequence in C++ . We are Given with an array of integers, we need to find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the sub-sequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.

Longest Consecutive subsequence
Method Discussed :
Method 1 : Brute Force
Method 2 : Using Hash-map
Method 3 : Using Priority Queue.
Method 1 (Brute force Approach) :
First sort the given input array.
Remove the multiple occurrences of elements, run a loop and keep a count and max (both initially zero).
Run a loop from 0 to N and if the current element is not equal to the previous (element+1) then set the count to 1 else increase the count.
Update max with a maximum of count and max.

Java Program to Find longest consecutive subsequence
Run

import java.util.*;
public
class Main {
    static int findLongestConseqSubseq(int arr[], int n)
    {
 
        // Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(arr);
 
        int ans = 0, count = 0;
       
        ArrayList v = new ArrayList();
        v.add(10);
       
        // Insert repeated elements
        // only once in the vector
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (arr[i] != arr[i - 1])
                v.add(arr[i]);
        }
    
 
        // Find the maximum length
        // by traversing the array
        for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++)
        {
 
            // Check if the current element is
            // equal to previous element +1
            if (i > 0 && v.get(i) == v.get(i - 1))
                count++;
            else
                count = 1;
 
            // Update the maximum
            ans = Math.max(ans, count);
        }
        return ans;
    }
 
    // Driver code
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int arr[] = { 1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2 };
        int n = arr.length;
 
        System.out.println(
            "Length of the Longest "
            + "contiguous subsequence is "
            + findLongestConseqSubseq(arr, n));
    }
}
Output :
Length of the Longest contiguous subsequence is 3

Method 2 :
First we will create a hash-map.
Now, iterate over the array for every i-th element check if this element is the starting point of a subsequence. To check this, simply look for arr[i] â€“ 1 in the hash, if not found, then this is the first element a subsequence.
If this element is the first element, then count the number of elements in the consecutive starting with this element. Iterate from arr[i] + 1 till the last element that can be found.
If the count is more than the previous longest subsequence found, then update this.

    static int findLongestConseqSubseq(int arr[], int n)
    {

        HashSet S = new HashSet();
        int ans = 0;


        // Hash all the array elements
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            S.add(arr[i]);

        // check each possible sequence from the start
        // then update optimal length
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            // if current element is the starting
            // element of a sequence
            if (!S.contains(arr[i] - 1))
            {
                // Then check for next elements
                // in the sequence
                int j = arr[i];
                while (S.contains(j))
                    j++;

                // update  optimal length if this
                // length is more
                if (ans < j - arr[i])
                    ans = j - arr[i];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }


    // Driver Code
    public static void main(String args[])

    {

        int arr[] = { 1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2 };
        int n = arr.length;
        System.out.println(
            "Length of the Longest consecutive subsequence is "
            + findLongestConseqSubseq(arr, n));
    }
}
Output :
Length of the Longest consecutive subsequence is 4
Method 3 :
In this method we will use priority queue.

Create a Priority Queue to store the element
Store the first element in a variable.
Remove it from the Priority Queue.
Check the difference between this removed first element and the new peek element
If the difference is equal to 1 increase count by 1 and repeats step 2 and step 3
If the difference is greater than 1 set counter to 1 and repeat step 2 and step 3
if the difference is equal to 0 repeat step 2 and 3
if counter greater than the previous maximum then store counter to maximum
Continue step 4 to 7 until we reach the end of the Priority Queue
Return the maximum value
